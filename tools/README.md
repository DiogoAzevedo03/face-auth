# 🧰 FaceAuth - Tools

## 📄 Overview

This folder contains utility scripts to **validate** and **compare** face embedding files (`.pkl`) used in the **FaceAuth** project.

These scripts are useful to ensure that:
- The generated embeddings are in the correct format.
- The face comparison works as expected.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

Make sure you have the required packages installed:

pip install numpy

### 2. Check an embedding
Run the following command to check if a .pkl embedding file is valid:

python tools/check_embedding.py

### 3. Compare two embeddings
Run the following command to calculate the distance between two .pkl files:


python tools/compare_embedding.py
📂 Note: The .pkl files must contain embeddings generated by generate_face_embedding.py, with 128 or 192 dimensions.

## 🎯 Purpose of each script
### check_embedding.py
✔️ Verifies if a .pkl file:

    Exists at the given path.

    Has the correct number of dimensions (128 or 192).

    Contains only values of type float or numpy.float32.

    Displays the first values for preview.

✅ Ideal to ensure an embedding is ready for face recognition.

### compare_embedding.py
📊 Compares two .pkl files and calculates the Euclidean distance between them:

    Distance < 0.8 → ✅ Same person (high similarity)

    Distance < 1.3 → 🟡 Probably the same person

    Distance ≥ 1.3 → ❌ Different people or bad capture
