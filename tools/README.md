#  FaceAuth - Tools

##  Overview

This folder contains utility scripts to **validate** and **compare** face embedding files (`.pkl`) used in the **FaceAuth** project.

These scripts are useful to ensure that:
- The generated embeddings are in the correct format.
- The face comparison works as expected.

---

##  How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

Install all required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Check an embedding
Run the following command to check if a .pkl embedding file is valid:

python tools/check_embedding.py

### 3. Compare two embeddings
Run the following command to calculate the distance between two .pkl files:


python tools/compare_embedding.py
 Note: The .pkl files must contain embeddings generated by generate_multiple_embedding.py, with 128 or 192 dimensions.

##  Purpose of each script
### check_embedding.py
 Verifies if a .pkl file:

    Exists at the given path.

    Has the correct number of dimensions (128 or 192).

    Contains only values of type float or numpy.float32.

    Displays the first values for preview.

 Ideal to ensure an embedding is ready for face recognition.

### compare_embedding.py
 Compares two .pkl files and calculates the Euclidean distance between them:

    Distance < 0.8 → Same person (high similarity)

    Distance < 1.3 → Probably the same person

    Distance ≥ 1.3 → Different people or bad capture
